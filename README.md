Object Oriented Office project

A network of smart furniture/appliance for sensing and instigating collaborative behavior.

####Review 9.26.13 Takeaway

The premise of the project, a series of connected objects operated providing a responsive function WITHIN the space seemed like it was well received. The focus on the idea of "collaboration" was probably a little heavy-handed, and didn't sit well with Janette. The existing intimacy of the space will be a challenge to work with because the need for chairs as a social communicators might be less relevant when everyone is within speaking distance. However, there was an interesting thread about the intimacy of the space inhibiting some communication, where some people (Nicola) felt awkward about carrying on conversations (interpersonal or on the phone) that everyone could hear. Likewise, the potential for the chairs to serve as a communicatory device between disconnected locales (such as Studio-X to Avery or Studio-X to Studio-X) could be an avenue for exploration for session B. The most popular idea, which seemed to align with the data-logging goals of other projects, was for the chairs to serve more as a device for recording habits of usage, positioning, and orientation in both the individual workstation environment and the collective shared table environment.

I think we also face a unique challenge in that our project has no unobtrusive options. While some elements may be incorporated into the "data" aspect of the studio, we still require direct physical contact with the users of Studio-X, and must find a way to integrate into their space without disruption (or unproductive disruption, that is).

I agree that one of the hardest parts of this project will be intigrating it into the existing office culture. I think that with a more traditional office space the collaboration idea would work better. I think that recording the habits of the office staff would be interesting but in the end it wouldnt produce anything physical in return. I might be interesting to have a record of the movements of the chair and at the end of the day a projector from the ceiling translates the paths into lights. They were really concerned about the lighting aspect, maybe this could be a good compromise. @kjscities
