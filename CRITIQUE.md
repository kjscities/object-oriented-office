Your project is about triggering responses in objects based on inputs sensed from the same or other objects. This will be done by connecting the sensor data to the cloud, where it can be processed, and then pushing it back down to physical space to trigger the appropriate actuators. The first step is to get an input to trigger an output. Jim's idea dealt with producing a sort of homeostatic environment, where increases in localized temperature triggered ventilation. Is homeostasis what you want? Could this be tuned by the manager of the space, or crowd sourced to it's inhabitants?

The best approach may be to come up with a very specific goal: perhaps you want to create a hyper efficient localized environment. If that's the case, perhaps your hypothesis is that people work better when they are cold and are standing up. How would you get one part of the room to stand and be cold while other parts of the room are in normal conditions?

You also have Kate's contribution of looking at printers. It's out of the scope of this course to tap into the serial port of a printer, but you could introduce your own. Check out the cheap thermal printer from Adafruit http://www.adafruit.com/products/597 and Google around to see what people have done with it (there are some decent art projects). These printers typically print receipts... what would an architecture office use a receipt for?

Thinking longer term, you may want to incorporate some of Allen's idea to have a web-based interface that would allow human users to tap into the loop, perhaps altering the triggered response in physical space by intercepting the signals and injecting new inputs. TogetherJS could be an interesting means of doing so. Take a look at the video on the homepage.
